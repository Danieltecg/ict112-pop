#reversed using slicing
reversed_text= letter[::-1]
print("Reveresed string: ", reversed_text)

for part in name_parts:
    initials += part[0].upper()+ "."
print("Initials: ", initials)

text=input("Enter a word please :")
text_lower=text.lower()
if text_lower==text_lower[::-1]:
    print("Good gracious! It is a Palindrome")
else:
    print("Never-mind, It is not a palindrome")
